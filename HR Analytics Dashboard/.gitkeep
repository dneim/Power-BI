This is my second completed Power BI dashboard 
[the 1st dashboard I have attempted can be found here: https://github.com/dneim/SQL/tree/main/Hotel%20Trends%20Analysis%20Project]

Dataset: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17zaiJnUOnLdHROWLZYcVlpMJ08wh-Bou/edit#gid=115883679

This project focused on simulated HR analytics that showed different metrics for personnel based on age, education level, and industry. 

Having practiced Tableau for a few months now, I wanted to see how well i could apply my skills to Power BI. [Please feel free to check out the Tableau
dashboard that was created using this same dataset: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/daniel.neiman1150/viz/HRAttritionAnanlytics/HRAnalyticsDashboard]
